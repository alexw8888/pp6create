# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is for creating a Python program to generate ProPresenter 6 (.pro6) documents and playlist directories programmatically. ProPresenter 6 is presentation software used primarily for worship services and events.

## Recent Updates (2025-06-07)

- Added song document generation with section arrangements
- Implemented automatic song detection based on "Arrangement" line in text files
- Fixed playlist XML structure to match ProPresenter 6 format exactly
- Added .pro6plx (zipped playlist) generation
- Environment variable support for PAGE_BREAK_EVERY (lines per slide)
- Added --pro6plx-only flag to create only .pro6plx file with temp directories

## Key Components

1. **pp6_creation_guide.md** - Comprehensive technical specification for the ProPresenter 6 XML format
2. **pp6playlist/** - Sample ProPresenter 6 playlist directory containing:
   - Various .pro6 document files (songs, announcements, sermons)
   - data.pro6pl playlist file
   - Media resources (images, videos) in ProgramData/ and Users/ subdirectories
3. **generate_pp6_doc.py** - Python module for generating individual ProPresenter 6 documents
4. **generate_pp6_playlist.py** - Python module for generating complete PP6 playlist directories with proper structure

## ProPresenter 6 Document Structure

.pro6 files are XML documents with specific structure:
- Root element: `<RVPresentationDocument>`
- Contains slides organized in groups (verses, chorus, etc.)
- Text content is Base64 encoded in multiple formats (PlainText, RTFData, WinFlowData)
- Supports media elements (images, videos) with URL-encoded paths
- Uses UUIDs for all elements and references

## Development Tasks

### Creating the Python Generator
1. Parse the XML structure of existing .pro6 files
2. Implement Base64 encoding for text content (UTF-8, RTF, XAML)
3. Generate valid UUID4 identifiers
4. Handle media file path encoding
5. Create proper slide groups and arrangements
6. Validate generated XML structure

### Key Technical Requirements
- All text must be Base64 encoded in three formats: PlainText (UTF-8), RTFData (RTF), and WinFlowData (XAML)
- UUIDs must be unique and in uppercase format
- Media paths need URL encoding
- Colors use RGBA format with 0-1 range values
- Standard resolution: 1024×768 or 1920×1080

### Common Commands
```bash
# Generate a single PP6 document (regular presentation)
python generate_pp6_doc.py --source source_materials/1 --output presentation.pro6

# Generate a song document with arrangements
python generate_pp6_doc.py --type song --source source_materials/3/song2.txt --output song.pro6

# Generate a PP6 playlist with automatic document generation
python generate_pp6_playlist.py

# Generate only .pro6plx file (uses temp directories for all other files)
python generate_pp6_playlist.py --pro6plx-only

# Generate a playlist with specific name
python generate_pp6_playlist.py --name "Sunday Service"

# Generate a playlist from existing documents
python generate_pp6_playlist.py doc1.pro6 doc2.pro6 doc3.pro6

# Generate playlist directory structure (old behavior)
python generate_pp6_playlist.py --output my_playlist_dir

# Validate XML output
xmllint --noout generated.pro6
```

## Architecture Considerations

The implemented Python modules include:
1. **generate_pp6_doc.py** - Core document generator with:
   - XML structure creation for individual .pro6 files
   - Base64 encoding for all text formats (PlainText, RTFData, WinFlowData)
   - UUID generation for all elements
   - Media file path encoding
   - CLI interface for creating documents

2. **generate_pp6_playlist.py** - Playlist generator with:
   - Complete playlist directory creation
   - data.pro6pl playlist file generation with proper XML structure
   - Automatic song detection (looks for "Arrangement" line)
   - Media file discovery and copying
   - Cross-platform path handling (Windows/macOS)
   - Document scanning for media references
   - .pro6plx (zipped playlist) creation
   - CLI interface for playlist creation
   - --pro6plx-only mode for creating only the .pro6plx file with automatic temp directory cleanup

## Song Document Features

Songs are detected by the presence of an "Arrangement" line in the text file. Song files should have:
- Section markers (e.g., V1, C1, V2, C2, B1)
- Lyrics under each section
- An "Arrangement" line followed by the section order (e.g., V1 C1 V1 C1 C1)

The generator will:
- Create colored slide groups for each section type (Verse=Blue, Chorus=Red, Bridge=White)
- Split sections into multiple slides based on PAGE_BREAK_EVERY environment variable
- Generate an RVSongArrangement element with the specified section order
- Set proper UUIDs for arrangement playback

## Important Notes

- The pp6_creation_guide.md contains the complete XML specification
- Sample .pro6 files in Sample playlist/ can be used as reference templates
- Chinese text support is important (note the Chinese filenames in samples)
- Media files should maintain relative paths when possible
- Songs support arrangements that define playback order

## Development Environment

- Python 3.x with virtual environment (venv)
- Required packages: python-dotenv
- Environment variables:
  - PAGE_BREAK_EVERY: Number of lines per slide for songs (default: 4)
