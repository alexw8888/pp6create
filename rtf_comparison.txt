RTF ENCODING COMPARISON BETWEEN GENERATED AND ORIGINAL FILES

KEY DIFFERENCES THAT MAY AFFECT TEXT VISIBILITY:

1. FILLCOLOR ATTRIBUTE IN RVTEXTELEMENT:
   - Generated: fillColor="0 0 0 1" (BLACK - text will be invisible on black background!)
   - Original: fillColor="0 0 0 0" (TRANSPARENT - correct for text overlay)

2. FONT DIFFERENCES IN RTF:
   - Generated: Uses "Arial" font with charset134
   - Original: Uses "PingFangSC-Regular" font with charset134
   
3. FONT SIZE IN RTF:
   - Generated: \fs24 (24 point)
   - Original: \fs59 (59 point)

4. TEXT POSITION:
   - Generated: {100 100 0 374 55} (x=100, y=100)
   - Original: {231 653 0 374 55} (x=231, y=653)

5. BACKGROUND IMAGE BEHAVIOR:
   - Generated: behavior="1" (may affect image display)
   - Original: behavior="2"

6. BACKGROUND IMAGE ENABLED:
   - Generated: enabled="false" (background image disabled!)
   - Original: enabled="true"

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. The fillColor="0 0 0 1" makes the text BLACK on a BLACK background - text will be invisible!
2. The background image is disabled in the generated file
3. Font size is much smaller (24pt vs 59pt)

SOLUTION:
The main issue is the fillColor. It should be "0 0 0 0" (transparent) not "0 0 0 1" (black).
